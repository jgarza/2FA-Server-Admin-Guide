# Deleting User Accounts

The Delete Users submenu is used to permanently delete users from 2FA ONE.
Note: Before you can delete a user, you must first set the user’s state to “Deactivated”. Deleting a user from 2FA ONE will not delete the user’s Active Directory account.

### To delete a user:
* Select the Delete Users submenu.
* Use the Find a Deactivated User screen to find existing users that are known to the system, who have been deactivated. 

You can either:
* Enter as much of the known user information in the User name, Domain and Email Fields and click Find This User.
* Or, Launch the Directory Lookup Tool and navigate to the user.


* Select from the list the user which you would like to delete.
* The 2FA ONE Server Users page will appear, requesting that you confirm deletion of the user. 
* Select Delete User to confirm the deletion or Back to List to cancel.
