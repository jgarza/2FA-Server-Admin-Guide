# Add User Licenses

User Licenses are consumed every time a user is added to the system. Licenses are added back to the pool if the user is deactivated and respectively deducts a license if a user is reactivated. Out-of-the box Trial Versions and standard versions are delivered with 25 Trial User Licenses. 

To add additional User Licenses do the following:

1.	Click on the Add User Licenses link.
2.	Enter your User License Key or browse to your license file.
3.	Click the Save button to add your users licenses.

Your User Licenses will be activated and will appear in the User Licenses Overview. Additional User Licenses can be purchased directly from 2FA or an authorized 2FA reseller.

**Note:** 	When you enter your first full User License key, any used Trial User Licenses (from the original 25) will automatically be deducted. 2FA will provide instructions on how to obtain your licenses upon purchase. The license will be provided along with instructions via email. If you require your unique Client Info to complete your license request, this ID is displayed with the Add User Licenses screen within 2FA One Server Administrator’s Portal. 

User Licenses are managed through the 2FA One Server database. In the event your database becomes corrupt 2FA will not be able to recover any unused User Licenses, as 2FA does not monitor the consumption of your User Licenses. Licensing is client-specific and unique for each customer. However, should you need to rebuild your 2FA One Server tables your User License data will be restored. We strongly suggest you implement proper back-up/restore and Business Continuity/Disaster Recovery processes to ensure the protection of your User License assets.
