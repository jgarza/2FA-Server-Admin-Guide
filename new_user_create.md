# Creating New Users

The New Users submenu is used to add new users to the system. Users must be entered into the system before they can be assigned to a state. There are three methods to add new users to the system:

* Add a New User: Enables administrators to add individual users.
* Bulk Import Users: Enables administrators to bulk import users through a CSV file.
* Auto Enroll: Enables administrators to allow users who exist in Active Directory to automatically enroll in 2FA
