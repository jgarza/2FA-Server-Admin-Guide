# Assigning Method Profiles to Sets

1.	Once you have created a new set, you are ready to assign default or custom Method Profiles to the set. To accomplish, this you must select Edit from the Set List, and then select Edit Profiles.
2.	The Edit Authentication Set dialog will appear. You will notice that the default profiles for the methods which have profiles are already selected. From this menu you may leave the default profile or assign any other available profile to your custom set.
  3.	By default, only the Default Profiles for Question & Answer and Contactless are available. If you have created custom Profiles, they will also be available for selection. 
3.	For Authentication Sets using the Question and Answer method you may also configure custom Profiles. 

By default, there are three Profiles available.
  4.	The profiles available for Question and Answer are:
      5.	**Emergency Access** – use this profile in conjunction with 2FA One Client to enable Emergency Access and Secure Workflows in 2FA One Server. The questions in this list are hard coded and cannot be changed due to the static nature of 2FA One Client’s question set.
    6.	**Secure Workflow Admin** – Use this profile if you would like to use the question sets within 2FA One Server for Secure Workflows only.
    7.	**Secure Workflow User** – Use this profile if you would like users to create their own questions to answer and use those answers within 2FA One Server for Secure Workflows only.
