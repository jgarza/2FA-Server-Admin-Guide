# Managing 2FA ONE Server: Roles

2FA ONE Server implements role separation. Nearly every feature and task within 2FA ONE Server can be assigned or prevented by roles. 2FA ONE Server Roles ensure that proper role separation can be created and enforced. 

Role separation is a critical feature of the system, as it provides the underpinnings for which tasks users and administrators can perform within the system.

Within the 2FA ONE Server Roles menu, there are four (4) sub-menus:

* Role List
* Create a new role
* Directory Mapping
* Reports
