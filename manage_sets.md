# Managing 2FA ONE Server: Authentication Sets

The Sets Tab is used to configure the manner in which authentication methods can be assigned to users within the system. 

The process is that Authentication Methods (and the associated profiles) are grouped into Authentication Sets, and Authentication Sets are assigned to Users.

Within the Sets menu there are three sub-menus:

1.	Set List
2.	New Set
3.	Global Settings
