# The Basics

### Overview
2FA One Server provides a browser-based system for managing the lifecycle of physical and digital credentials used for strong authentication.

### 2FA One Server:
* Leverages identity data in directories and identity repositories
* Requires that only a single server be installed within the enterprise (per Microsoft Directory Forest) that can manage multiple domains, portals, and other points of authentication


### The 2FA solution is comprised of:
* Application web server (2FA One Server)
* Client-based software (2FA One Server Drivers or 2FA One Client)
* Contact or contactless cards and their associated components
