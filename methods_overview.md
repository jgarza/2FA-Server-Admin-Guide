# Methods Overview

The Overview sub-menu provides an overview of the authentication methods and associated configurations currently installed on the system.

Within this sub-menu you can configure the attempt limit by selecting Edit. 

Each method can be configured independently. 

Take care when increasing the limit as the higher the number, the lower the overall security will be. 

However, the lower the number, the higher the risk will be that users who fail a logon attempt, will be deactivated.

**Note:** Setting the attempt limit on methods only affects the number of invalid attempts by a user before the user’s account is locked out of 2FA One Server. Once locked out, the user’s state will be automatically set to Deactivated.
