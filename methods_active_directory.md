# Active Directory Method

This sub-menu provides the functionality of enabling PKI, enabling users to authenticate to a system utilizing their Active Directory user name and password, and disabling Active Directory accounts. 

Depending on the features desired, you must enter an account that has read permissions to the forest root and has account password change/reset and change account control permissions throughout the forest or the domains in which usersâ€™ passwords are managed. 

An account in the domain admin group has both of these permissions. If the account password is changed within Active Directory, it will need to be updated in this screen to avoid potential errors.

### Domain DNS Mapping

Domain DNS Mapping can be used when there are problems with the domain information returned when the 2FA ONE queries Active Directory. In rare cases this may happen when upgrading domains from legacy Microsoft domain structuring.
